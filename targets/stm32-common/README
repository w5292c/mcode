Building stm32-cmake
====================
Use the script in this directory to build 'stm32-cmake', like this:
$ GITHUB_ROOT=<path-to-your-project-directory> ./build-stm32-cmake.sh

Here, <path-to-your-project-directory> is the directory that you want to use
for cloning a couple of git repositories during building.
For example, I use the following directory:
* /home/alex/projects/github/
It may contain, for example, the following sub-folders
(the script above will clone 'stm32-spd' and 'stm32-cmake'):
* /home/alex/projects/github/mcode/
* /home/alex/projects/github/stm32-spd/
* /home/alex/projects/github/stm32-cmake/
